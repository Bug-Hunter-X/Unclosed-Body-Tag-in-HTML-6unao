This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error in HTML: an unclosed body tag.  This can lead to unpredictable rendering and validation issues. The `bug.html` file showcases the error, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.  This is a simple example, but the principle applies to more complex HTML documents where neglecting proper closing tags can have significant consequences.
